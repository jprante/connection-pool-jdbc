This connection pool implementation is a derived work from HikariCP Version 3.4.5 (May 2020)

https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP

published under Apache 2.0 License.

Motivations for the derived work:

- remove all dependencies
- remove everything with metrics
- remove everything with JMX
- remove everything with slf4j logging
- remove everything with OSGI, Hibernate, Spring, JNDI
- remove everything with javassist
- remove everything with suspend/resume
- fix module-info.java
- remove MacOS "milli second" clock
- clean up source code, packages, inheritances, inner classes refactoring, get rid of helper classes
- no system property dark magic
- no addDataSourceProperty magic, pass a Properties object always to PoolConfig which contains JDBC driver properties
- Java 11+
- JUnit 5+
- Gradle 6.4+

The result is an 88k jar.
